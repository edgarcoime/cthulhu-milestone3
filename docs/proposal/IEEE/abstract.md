# Abstract

In the modern digital landscape, file sharing has become an essential collaboration tool; however, mainstream platforms often prioritize persistent storage and user profiling over privacy and usability, imposing barriers such as mandatory account creation. Furthermore, these systems frequently lack robust security measures against vulnerabilities like Unrestricted File Uploads (UFU). This project presents **Cthulhu**, an anonymous-first file sharing platform designed to mitigate these issues through a security-centric and privacy-focused approach. Cthulhu utilizes a scalable microservice architecture, employing **Next.js** for the frontend and **Golang** for backend services, with **RabbitMQ** facilitating asynchronous inter-service communication. Key features include strict temporal file availability—defaulting to 48 hours for anonymous users—rigorous server-side validation, **SHA-256** hashing for file anonymization, and integrated malware detection using **ClamAV**. This report details the architectural design, including the implementation of the **SAGA pattern** for distributed transactions, and evaluates the system's effectiveness in providing a secure, transient, and user-friendly file sharing experience.
