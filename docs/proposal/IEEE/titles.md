# Potential IEEE Report Titles for Cthulhu

1.  **Cthulhu: A Privacy-Preserving, Anonymous-First File Sharing Architecture Using Microservices**
    *   *Focus:* Highlights the system's name, its primary goal (privacy/anonymity), and the underlying architectural style.

2.  **Mitigating Unrestricted File Upload Risks in Transient Storage Systems via Distributed Event-Driven Scanning**
    *   *Focus:* Emphasizes the security research aspect, specifically addressing the UFU vulnerability and the solution (distributed scanning), which is highly relevant to IEEE security tracks.

3.  **Design and Implementation of a Scalable, Ephemeral File Sharing Service with SAGA-Based Data Consistency**
    *   *Focus:* Centers on the software engineering challenges, specifically the ephemeral nature of the data and the distributed transaction management (SAGA).

4.  **Securing Anonymous Data Exchange: A Microservices Approach to Temporal File Lifecycles and Malware Detection**
    *   *Focus:* A comprehensive title that covers the application domain (anonymous data), the architecture, and the specific technical contributions (temporal lifecycles, security).

5.  **Evaluating the Performance of Event-Driven Architectures in High-Throughput, Privacy-Centric File Sharing Applications**
    *   *Focus:* detailed technical evaluation, suitable if your report includes performance metrics or architectural analysis of the gRPC, AWS SQS, and Golang stack.
